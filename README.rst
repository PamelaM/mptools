Mutliprocessing Tools provides wrappers to help you implement robust applications.
This project began while working on a number of IoT projects and was fleshed out while I was
writing up a talk proposal and blog post based on what I'd learned. (TODO: Url goes here)



* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://mptools.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* TODO

Examples
--------

 * `examples/mptools_example.py` provides a fairly complete sketch of an IoT kind of app, though
it doesn't do much.
 * `examples/mptools_example_client.py` is a simple script that exercises the socket
interface of the example app.

Roadmap
--------

 * Write up proper docs and get them up on Readthedocs
